# One Thousand~ Pixels
SUPSI MAInD  
Programming interctive objects  
Workshop 5–9.1.2024

# Project Brief
The aim of the workshop is to embrace constratints and develop ideas aroun

# Topics
- Idea driven development and research 
- Realtime graphics and animation concepts 
- Serial communication 
- Quick prototyping 
- LED matrices 

# Part list
- RGB LED matrix 32x32 P6 (P6 means that the LED pitch is 6mm)
- PicoDriver, custom ESP32 controller
- USB-C cable (data + power)
- 5V power cable for the LED matrix (usually comes with the matrix)

Aleternative to PicoDriver:  
- [Teensy 4.0 or 4.1 development board](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/) (a Teensy 3.2 will do but has limited memory)
- [SmartLed shield](https://docs.pixelmatix.com/SmartMatrix/) (not strictly necessary but handy to quickly connect the microcontroller)
- Micro-USB cable
- 5V power supply (3A minimum), plus cables

# Software requirements
- [VS Code](https://platformio.org)
- [Platformio for VS Code](https://platformio.org)
- [Processing IDE](https://www.processing.org/download/)
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
